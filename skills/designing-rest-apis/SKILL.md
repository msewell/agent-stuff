description: "Guides designing, reviewing, and governing RESTful APIs — resource modeling, URL structure, HTTP methods, status codes, error handling (RFC 9457), pagination, versioning, security, authentication, caching, idempotency, bulk operations, async patterns, file uploads, OpenAPI documentation, API-first process, and AI-agent consumers. Use when designing new REST API endpoints, reviewing existing API designs, adopting API-first development, running API design sessions, enforcing API contracts in CI/CD, governing an API program, choosing between REST patterns (cursor vs offset pagination, PUT vs PATCH, polling vs webhooks), writing OpenAPI specs, designing for AI-agent consumers (MCP), or making API evolution and deprecation decisions."

# Designing REST APIs

## Workflow: Designing a new API

1. **Model resources as nouns.** Identify domain entities. Use plural nouns for collection URLs (`/orders`, not `/getOrders`). Express relationships with sub-resources, max 2–3 levels deep.
2. **Assign HTTP methods by semantics.** GET=read, POST=create, PUT=full replace, PATCH=partial update, DELETE=remove. For non-CRUD actions, use POST with a clear resource name (`POST /orders/7/cancellation`).
3. **Define request/response schemas.** Use camelCase for JSON fields, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for enums, RFC 3339 for dates in UTC. Wrap collections in `{ "data": [...] }`. Use string type for IDs. Represent money as smallest currency unit + currency code.
4. **Select status codes.** Return the most specific code: `201` for creation (with `Location` header), `204` for no-content success, `409` for conflicts, `422` for business rule violations. Never return `200` with an error body.
5. **Design error responses using RFC 9457** (Problem Details). Include `type` (URI), `title`, `status`, `detail`. Return all validation errors at once. Never leak stack traces.
6. **Add pagination to every list endpoint.** Default: cursor-based pagination. Use offset pagination only for small/static datasets needing jump-to-page. Always include `has_more` or a `next` link.
7. **Plan versioning.** Use URI path versioning (`/v1/`). Only bump for breaking changes. Support at least one prior version with 6–12 month migration window. Signal deprecation via `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers.
8. **Address cross-cutting concerns.** Add rate limiting headers on every response. Use `Cache-Control` + ETags. Require idempotency keys for POST endpoints with side effects. Use `Authorization: Bearer` for auth.
9. **Write the OpenAPI spec first** (design-first, not code-first). Use OpenAPI 3.1. Document every endpoint, every status code, every error type. Lint with Spectral or Redocly CLI.

## Workflow: Adopting API-first process

1. **Identify consumers.** List every team and system that will call the API before designing anything. If consumers aren't in the room, the API will be optimised for the producer.
2. **Run a design session.** Start from the consumer's workflow, not the data model. Sketch endpoints and payloads informally before writing YAML. Name disagreements immediately — they're cheap to resolve now, expensive later.
3. **Write the spec first.** Formalize the agreed design as an OpenAPI spec. Review it via PR with automated linting, consumer sign-off, and breaking change detection. Change the spec first, then the implementation — never the reverse.
4. **Generate mocks immediately.** Unblock consumers with a mock server (Prism, Postman Mock Server) the moment the spec is agreed. Consumers build against the mock while the backend builds against the same spec.
5. **Enforce the contract in CI/CD.** Lint specs on every PR. Detect breaking changes before merge. Validate implementation responses against the spec. Run consumer contract tests. Automate all of this — process discipline alone erodes under deadline pressure.
6. **Govern lightly.** Maintain an API catalog tracking each API's lifecycle stage (draft → active → deprecated → retired). Signal deprecation via `Deprecation` and `Sunset` headers with a migration guide and sunset date.
7. **Design for AI-agent consumers.** Write `description` fields as if explaining to a non-expert. Provide `example` values for every field. Use clear `operationId` values. A complete, well-described OpenAPI spec is nearly MCP-compatible for free.

## Workflow: Reviewing an existing API

1. **Check resource modeling.** Flag verb-based URLs, deep nesting (>3 levels), inconsistent pluralization, trailing slashes, or file extensions in URLs.
2. **Check HTTP method usage.** Flag GET with side effects, POST used for retrieval, PUT used for partial updates, missing `Location` header on `201` responses.
3. **Check error handling.** Flag custom error formats (should use RFC 9457), `200` with error bodies, leaked internals, one-error-at-a-time validation.
4. **Check pagination.** Flag unbounded list endpoints, offset pagination on large datasets, missing `has_more`/`next` indicators.
5. **Check security.** Verify HTTPS-only, object-level authorization (not just endpoint-level), input validation, rate limiting, CORS whitelist (no `*` on authenticated endpoints).
6. **Check naming consistency.** Flag mixed casing conventions, nullable booleans (should be enums), integer enum values (should be strings), bare array responses.
7. Report findings grouped by severity (breaking issues → best practice violations → suggestions).

## Key decisions (defaults with escape hatches)

| Decision | Default | Alternative (when) |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Pagination | Cursor-based | Offset — small/static data needing page numbers |
| Partial update | PATCH with JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) | JSON Patch (RFC 6902) — need array ops or conditional updates |
| Versioning | URI path (`/v1/`) | Content negotiation — per-resource granularity needed |
| Auth | OAuth 2.0 + JWT (RS256, 15–30 min TTL) | API keys — simple server-to-server; mTLS — service mesh |
| Async pattern | 202 Accepted + status polling | Webhooks — server-to-server event-driven |
| Upload method | Multipart form data (1–100 MB) | Presigned URLs — cloud-native; Resumable — >100 MB |
| Error format | RFC 9457 (Problem Details) | — (no alternative; this is the standard) |
| Rate limiting | Token bucket | Sliding window — smoother enforcement |
| JSON casing | camelCase | snake_case — Python/Ruby-centric ecosystem |
